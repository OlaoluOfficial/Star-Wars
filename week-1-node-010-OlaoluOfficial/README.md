## Problem Description:

You are to create a SPA (single page application) application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
It shows all characters from a star wars API (https://swapi.dev/api/people).
Read the documentation and implement as follows.

### Process ?

1. Display an image for each of the characters. Preferrably a unique image for each but
   you could also choose to use a dummy image for all of them.

2. Make a HTTP request to the star wars API and use the result from the request to
   populate your frontend application

- Display a list with the names of each person from the API request.
- On Clicking any name, display the details of that user on the screen, with name, gender, height only

3. All implementations should be done using es6.

4. Make your design pretty and responsive.

5. When you are done, host your application on heroku or netlify
   (submit link should be added to your turned in field on Teams)

6. Also please note that all this should be done with JavaScript.
   You should not write html markup in your index.html file for each of the characters.
   You should get the data from the star wars API on page load using JavaScript and
   render all the characters also using JavaScript.
